Ooh
Stop
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
If there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hidin' behind the rocks
Except the little fish, bumped into me
I swear he was trying to talk to me, koi-koi
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
If there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
do you like my two fat cocks
fisting is 300 bucks
do you like amazing sex
stick your finger in my ass
where is my mind
where is my mind
